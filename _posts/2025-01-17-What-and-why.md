# Who Am I

I would describe myself as a curious person—someone simply trying their best to explore and understand the world. Like anyone else, I make assumptions about people and places, but I’m always happy to be proven wrong. That just means I’ve learned something new.

I was born and raised in India and currently live in the UK. But more than identifying with a country, I see myself as a citizen of the world. I’m always excited to meet new people and hear their stories—each life offering a perspective I might never have considered.

# What I Do

## I Love to Learn

I’m easily drawn to anything that offers an opportunity to learn. Whether it’s a new hobby, a practical skill, or a deep dive into some obscure rabbit hole, I'm always looking to grow—even if just a little bit.

How I learn changes all the time. Some days it’s documentaries or podcasts. Other days, it’s books or endless Wikipedia spirals. Whatever the medium, the goal is the same: to better understand myself and the world around me.

## I Make Photos

Photography is one of the ways I connect with the world. When I’m behind the camera—whether capturing nature, people, or everyday objects—I try to see things more clearly, more intimately.

Photographing people, in particular, is a deeply vicarious experience. It allows me to momentarily step into someone else's world, to better understand the lives that pass me by each day.

I mostly shoot in London, with favorite spots like South Bank, Marsh Lane, Hyde Park, and Shoreditch. While I do share some of my work online, most of my photos are taken for myself—for the quiet joy of observing.

I also enjoy looking at other people’s photography. I often visit photo exhibits in London galleries. I like to think of this as _nested vicariousness_: trying to experience what the photographer experienced as _they_ tried to experience their subject.

## I Like to Fiddle Around

I have a natural tendency to tinker. If something piques my interest, I want to get my hands on it and figure out how it works. Most often, this curiosity leads me into the world of technology—especially software.

From running my personal Linux servers to automating repetitive tasks at work, I’m always looking for ways to make things smoother, simpler, or just more interesting. This habit of “fiddling” has often led to some of my most impactful contributions at work—usually sparked by boredom and a desire to make life easier for myself and others.
