I am currently a Research Assistant at the Welding and Additive Manufacturing Centre (WAMC), Cranfield University, UK. My work focuses on process
modelling and numerical simulations, particularly using the Finite Element Method (FEM) to understand and predict thermo-mechanical phenomena in
advanced manufacturing processes.

Outside of research, I develop numerical solvers and computational tools to make simulations for materials and manufacturing more robust and efficient,
with broader interests in scientific computing and mathematical modelling.

For a deeper look at my professional background, see my [CV](cv/). My personal reflections and thoughts on learning and
building are in this [blog post](blog/2025/What-and-why/).
