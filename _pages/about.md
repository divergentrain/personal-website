I am a Research Assistant at the Welding and Additive Manufacturing Centre at Cranfield University, UK. My specialisation lies in the field of process modelling and simulations, specifically in the Finite Element Method (FEM). Apart from developing models, I have a keen interest in scientific computing, writing code for numerical solvers and mathematical modelling of materials.

Outside of work hours, I enjoy photography, playing retro games and contributing to open source. When it comes to reading, I prefer non-fiction. My music taste includes a little bit of everything but I am a big fan of metal, ambient and intelligent electronic music.
